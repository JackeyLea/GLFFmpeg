## GLFFmpeg

GLFFmpeg uses the video recording functionality provided by the FFmpeg library to capture content generated using OpenGL.

The GLFFmpeg library provides a minimalistic set of entry points into the (very thorough) FFmpeg API to simplify the task of capturing OpenGL output to a video stream.

See the samples included with the distribution for usage.
