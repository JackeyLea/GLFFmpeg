GLFFmpeg README

1) Documentation
----------------

	GLFFmpeg uses the video recording functionality provided by 
        the FFmpeg library to capture content generated using OpenGL.
	
        The GLFFmpeg library provides a minimalistic set of entry points 
        into the (very thorough) FFmpeg API to simplify the task of
        capturing OpenGL output to a video stream.

        See the samples included with the distribution for usage.

        Pre-built binaries for ffmpeg on Windows can be found at:
